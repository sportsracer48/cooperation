# The social evolution of cooperation

Henry Rachootin

The biological cooperation of evolution is fascinating, but it is also important to consider how cooperation emerges in social settings. The idea that biology is inherently competitive is widely believed but not particularly problematic, even if it is somewhat reductive. More often, the idea that society is or ought to be inherently competitive is a source of endless cruelty and ignorance. To remedy this, I investigate the question: what factors lead to the natural emergence of cooperative behavior in a social network?

In [2], Ohdaira  presents a model for social cooperation and selfishness. It is an evolutionary game theory networked prisoner's dilemma model, in which a network of agents play a single round of the prisoner's dilemma against each of their neighbors, then copy the strategy of their neighbor with the highest total score (or they don't change, if they have a higher score than their neighbors). The strategies are as simplistic as possible: they either always cooperate or always defect.

Ohdaira shows that adding a 'decision cost' to the agents allows cooperation to dominate faster in ring lattice, Watts Strogatz [3], and Barabasi Albert [2] networks, than it does without the decision cost. The decision cost is a component of each agent's strategy. and is a value chosen from a uniform distribution on [0, 1] which is subtracted from the agent's score after they have played all of their rounds.
